## 🚀 Notable Projects

### [AgentifiedDesign2Code](https://github.com/radmanesh/agentbeats-design2code)
A multi-agent extension of the Design2Code pipeline created as part of the [Berkeley AgentBeats Competition](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/agentx-agentbeats). This system enables a generation agent to produce HTML and CSS while an evaluation agent scores layout fidelity using Playwright, geometric IoU analysis, and multi-device screenshot comparison, and the fully agentified A2A workflow reproduces original Design2Code benchmarks while supporting structured critique-and-repair loops and tool-driven reasoning workflows.

### [ResponsiveGen: Multi-Device Sketch-to-Code System](https://github.com/radmanesh/ResponsiveGen)
A vision-enabled LLM pipeline that converts mobile, tablet, and desktop wireframe sketches into fully responsive HTML and CSS, featuring an evaluation suite that integrates screenshot comparison, geometric layout analysis, and LLM-as-judge rubric scoring to benchmark how effectively multimodal models generate production-quality responsive layouts.

### **Intelligent Faculty Recommendation Engine (OU DSAI)**
An LLM-powered semantic search and ranking system that matches PhD proposals to the most relevant faculty across OU, using LlamaIndex, LangChain, LangGraph, Qwen models, and ChromaDB to ingest CVs, publications, and proposal documents and perform expertise extraction, vector retrieval, and accurate ranking at scale.

### [Jamasp](https://jamasp.app)
A scalable platform for wearable-device research with participant management and AI-enabled analytics. Built for behavioral science research with real-time data collection and analysis capabilities.

### [Lens (Cut)](https://cut.social)
A mobile-friendly toolkit (ReactJS, MongoDB) for behavioral experiments including ultimatum games, memory tests, and fasting studies. Designed for social research applications.
